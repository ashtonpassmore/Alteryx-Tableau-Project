# Alteryx-Tableau-Project
Using Alteryx and MLB data I created various pipelines to analyze how successful the Colorado Rockies have been as a franchise, 
as well as analyze player salaries during the time that they’ve been a franchise. I also used Alteryx to analyze their 
attendance in the time that they’ve been a franchise. I then used Tableau to make various graphs to visualize some of the 
pipelines I had created in Alteryx.
